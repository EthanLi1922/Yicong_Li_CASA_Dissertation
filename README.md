# Yicong_Li_CASA_Dissertation

**This is part of the work for my CASA Dissertation, including all coding files and some data files used in this study.**

DissertationThe research question for this Dissertation is: The future of community public libraries: How does the accessibility of public libraries within Greater London impact community socio-economic indicators?

The entire folder for this study has now been uploaded. **Please do not move the directory around, as this will cause errors when reading the data and generating files or images.**

Since many of the files used and generated in this study are over 100MB and, therefore, cannot be uploaded to GitHub, I have compressed some files as much as possible and uploaded them in ZIP format. The uploaded files contain all of the code files used in this research and some of the data files. 

The missing data is described in detail in the corresponding folder. These data are publicly available and can be accessed by looking at the “Data Sources Table” in the dissertation thesis.

**Before using this folder, please make sure that all zipped files are extracted to the original path.**

**There is one point to highlight: due to the memory limitations of my computer, I am unable to combine all codes, especially the different travel modes, into a single notebook. As a result, I maintain separate notebooks for each travel mode. While 95% of the content across these notebooks remains consistent, specific variable names differ. This clarification is provided for your understanding.**
