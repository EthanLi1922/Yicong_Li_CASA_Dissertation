DissertationThe research question for this Dissertation is: The future of community public libraries: How does the accessibility of public libraries within Greater London impact community socio-economic indicators?

This is part of the code for my CASA Dissertation.

The data used in the code cannot be uploaded because it is over 100MB. You can get it through the link in my thesis; they are all public data.

Also, the notebook that calculates the DIFFERENT travel modes is over 100MB, so unfortunately, I can't upload it right away. I am working on a solution to this problem, so please wait!
